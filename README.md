# ThreatConnect Playbooks

+ Help promote usage of ThreatConnect via a community of developers,
+ Help customers identify new use cases, and
+ Give new customers the opportunity to learn from existing customers.

This Repository is public. However, contributions will be accepted only from identified ThreatConnect customers. The ThreatConnect Support Team will validate each contribution request before they are published within the Repository, as well as enforce certain formatting requirements.
