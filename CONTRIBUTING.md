# Playbooks Contribution Guide

Contributing to the ThreatConnect Playbooks Github repository is a powerful and scalable way to make a positive impact to the infosec community. At ThreatConnect, we believe that Threat Intelligence can have a visible impact on your company’s success, and that orchestration and automation is a force multiplier for Threat Intelligence.

## Guidelines

+ All Playbooks and Playbook Apps must have their own README.md files.
  + Playbooks README.md should include the following headers:
    + Summary
    + App Dependencies
    + Use Cases (Optional)
  + Playbooks Apps README.md should include the following headers:
    + Summary
    + Dependencies
    + Input Definitions
    + Output Definitions
    + Use Cases (Optional)
+ Playbooks and Playbook Apps should be included in unique, separate folders.
  + Playbooks must include the PBX file of the Playbook.
  + Playbook Apps must include the zip/tcx file of the App.

## Contributing Playbooks

Playbooks are stored in JSON as PBX files, which allows them to be easily shared between instances of ThreatConnect.

In order to contribute a Playbook, first Export the Playbook as a PBX file from your instance of ThreatConnect, then create a Pull request. To modify or use the Playbook in your instance, click the “Import Playbook” button and select the appropriate PBX file.

## Contributing Playbook Apps

A Playbook App is a single component of a Playbook. These Apps are intended to be reusable standalone components with minimum functionality to solve a single purpose. Multiple Playbook Apps will make up a Playbook that solves a use case.

## Contribution Best Practices

**Give your Playbook and App a descriptive name.** There are hundreds of Playbooks and Apps, so it's important that the name is notable and references key functions and/or integrations. For example, "Triage" is bad, "Email Triage" is better, "VirusTotal Email Triage" is awesome, and "VirusTotal Email Triage & Detonation - Host, Address, and Mutex Ingestion" is best.

**Include a description in the Playbook or App.** Just like commenting in code, this helps other users better understand the purpose of your contribution and how to use it most effectively in their environment.
